            This document analyzes the mobile user plane protocol and the
            architecture specified in 3GPP 5G documents. The analysis work is to
            clarify those specifications, extract protocol and architectural
            requirements and derive evaluation aspects for user plane protocols
            on IETF side. This work is corresponding to the User Plane Protocol
            Study work on 3GPP side.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This document analyzes the mobile user plane protocol and the
        architecture specified by 3GPP 5G documents. The background of the work
        is that 3GPP requests through a liaison statement that the IETF to
        provide any information for the User Plane Protocol Study work in 3GPP
        <xref target="CP-180116-3GPP"/>. Justification and the objectives of the
        study can be found from <xref target="CP-173160-3GPP"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        We understand that the current user plane protocol, <xref
        target="TS.29.281-3GPP">GTP-U</xref>, has been well developed in 3GPP,
        and deployed very widely as the successor of legacy network
        technologies, such as TDM circuit, or ATM virtual circuit. That GTP-U
        success seems based on IP overlay technique that is dramatically scaled
        compare to the previous ones because it successfully isolates mobile
        session states from the user plane transport network.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Even after that big success, it is definitely worth that 3GPP has
        decided to revisit user plane which seems to response to IPv6 deployment
        growth and <xref target="IAB-Statement"/> that encourages
        the industry to develop strategies for IPv6-only operation. It can be
        seen from the justification section in <xref target="CP-173160-3GPP"/>.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The study description mentions that the study would be based on Release
        16 requirement while only Release 15 specifications has been available
        now. However we believe that to provide adequate information for 3GPP,
        we need to clearly understand what the current user plane protocol is in
        Release 15, and architectural requirements for the user plane.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        As the liaison statement indicates 3GPP specifications related to user
        plane, those documents should be a good start point to clarify their
        specifications and to extract protocol and architectural requirements
        from them.
      </t>

      <section title="Current Status of Mobile User Plane for 5G">
        <t>
          3GPP RAN and CT4 decided to use GTP-U as the 5G user plane
          encapsulation protocol over N3 and N9 that respectively described
          in<xref target="TS.38.300-3GPP" /> and <xref target="TR.29.891-3GPP"
          />. N3 is an interface between RAN and UPF and N9 is an interface
          between different UPFs <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP" />.
        </t>

        <t>
          In <xref target="TR.29.891-3GPP"/>, it captured user plane
          requirements and concluded that GTP-U is adopted for the user plane
          protocol. It seems that GTP-U was only option to be chose and it
          focused on how to carry 5G specific QoS information between UPF and
          access networks. That is described in section 5.2 and 11.2 of <xref
          target="TR.29.891-3GPP"/>. Another aspects of user plane requirements
          couldn't be found. 
        </t>
      </section>
        
      <section title="Our Way of Analysis Work">
        <t>
          First, we analyze <xref target="TS.29.281-3GPP"/> for clarifying it
          as the current user plane protocol in the 5G system. <xref
          target="TR.29.891-3GPP"/> describes how GTP-U is selected as the user
          plane protocol for 5G in 3GPP. Clarified characteristics of the
          protocol are described in <xref target="gtp-u"/>. 
        </t>
      
        <t>
          Then, to clarify what are required to the user plane protocol in
          architecture level, we analyze <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/> as the
          5G system architecture specification. <xref target="TS.23.502-3GPP"/> is
          the specification of system procedures that helps us to understand how
          the system works in the architecture. <xref target="TS.23.503-3GPP"/> is
          also helpful to find the role of user plane in the architecture that
          influences user plane protocol. Extracted architectural requirements are
          described in <xref target="arch"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          Based on the results of above, we identify some aspects where there
          might be gap between the current user plane protocol and the
          architectural requirements on which <xref target="TR.29.891-3GPP"/> does
          not discuss. That aspects are discussed <xref target="eval_aspects"/>.
          That's what we intend to be as a part of the reply to 3GPP. CT4 WG in 3GPP
          can utilize it as an input to evaluate the candidate protocols for user
          plane to the 5G system including the current protocol.
        </t>
      
        <t>
          <xref target="I-D.bogineni-dmm-optimized-mobile-user-plane"/> will
          provide the candidate protocols on IETF side to the 3GPP study.
        </t>
      </section>
      
    </section>
      
    <section title="Terms and Abbreviations">

      <t>
        This section describes terms of functions and interfaces relevant to
        user plane protocol which we extract from the 3GPP specifications since
        this document focuses on user plane.
      </t>

      <t>
        In those specifications, there are so many unique terms and
        abbreviations in the 3GPP context which IETF community seems not
        familiar with. We will try to bring those terms with brief explanations
        to make sure common understanding for them.

          Noted that the PDU in 3GPP includes IP header in case that PDU session
          type is IPv4 or IPv6. In contrast, in IETF it is supposed that PDU is
          the payload of IP packet so that it doesn't include  IP/TCP/UDP header
          in end-to-end.

        </t>
        
        <t>
          GTP-U has above two notions on PDU. T-PDU is a PDU that GTP-U header
          encapsulates. G-PDU is a PDU that includes GTP-U header. A G-PDU may
          include a T-PDU. G-PDU can be sent without T-PDU, but just with
          extension headers or TLV elements. It can be used for OAM related 
          operations.
        </t>

          Encapsulating user end-to-end PDU.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          In fact, we can't find exact text that defines UP in the architecture
          specification. However when we see the figure 8.3.1-1 in <xref
          target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>, we specify UP as the layer right under PDU
          that directly encapsulates PDU. Underneath layers of UP are UP
          transport, such as IP/UDP, L2 and L1.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          However 3GPP is consistent to use the term user plane when they
          indicate that layer. In IETF, we can see the terms data plane, or
          forwarding plane as variations which often makes us tend to be
          confused in terminology.

      <t>
        In this section we analyze the GTP-U specification and summarize

      <section title="GTP-U Tunnel">
        <t>
          GTP-U is a tunneling protocol between GTP-U tunnel endpoint nodes and
          encapsulates T-PDU from UE on top of IP/UDP. TEID value allocated on
          each end point which tunnel indicates particular T-PDU belongs to.
          That is described in section 4.2.1 of <xref target="TS.29.281-3GPP" />.

        <t>
          Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) tunneling enables one sender tunnel

          this dynamic allocation is described in section 4.4.2.0 of <xref
          target="TS.29.281-3GPP" />, however specific procedure, e.g., 5-tuple

          GTP-U supports both IPv4 and IPv6 as underlying transport layer

          target="TS.29.281-3GPP" />. As <xref target="RFC2460"/> does not allow
          the tunnel protocols on top of UDP to set the checksum value to zero,
          the GTP-U specification inherits it while the IPv4 transport for GTP-U
          case allows UDP zero checksum. It is noted that the IPv6 specification
          in IETF has been updated to <xref target="RFC8200"/> which allows UDP
          zero checksum for the tunnel. <xref target="RFC6935"/> describes

      <section anchor="archi-overview" title="Overview of 5G System Architecture">
      <t>
        The 5G system is designed for applying to diverse devices and services
        such, and the UP protocol is required to have capabilities for
        satisfying their requirements. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
        As a principle of the 5G system, User Plane (UP) functions are separated
        from the Control Plane (CP) functions for allowing independent
        scalability, evolution and flexible deployments.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Network slicing, one of the fundamental concepts of the 5G system,
        provides logical network separation. In terms of user plane, multiple
        network slices can be comprised of UPFs on top of same physical network
        resources. Allocated resources and structures may be differentiated
        among the slices by which the required features or capabilities.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The architecture overview is shown in <xref
        target="fig_3GPP-5GS-ARCH"/>. The details of functions are described in
        <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>. User plane path and applied functions
        for a tunnel will be manipulated based on application requirements that
        the PDU session corresponding to the tunnel is available to be handled
        by other authorized functions through the control plane.

    <section anchor="archi-req" title="Architectural Requirements for User Plane
    Protocols">
      <t>
        This section lists the requirements for the UP protocol on the 5G
        system. The requirements are picked up from <xref
        target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>. In addition, some of service requirements
        described in <xref target="TS.22.261-3GPP"/> are referred to clarify the
        originations of architectural requirements.
      </t>
    
      <t>
        According to <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>, the specifications
        potentially have assumptions that the user plane protocol is a tunnel
        representing a single TEID between a pair of UPFs and it is
        corresponding to a single PDU session. In short, the UP protocol is a
        tunnel and it is assumed to be managed under per PDU session handling.
        Also, it should be a stateful tunnel in the UPFs along with the PDU
        session.
      </t>
    
      <t>
        The requirements for UP protocols are described below:
      </t>
        
      <t>
        <list style="format ARCH-Req-%d:" counter="arch-req">

            Supporting IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet and Unstructured PDU
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t> 
        The 5G system defines four types of PDU session as IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet,
        and Unstructured. Therefore, UP protocol must support to convey all of
        these PDU session types.  This is described in <xref
        target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Note: In TS 23.501 v15.2.0, IPv4v6 is added as a PDU session type.

        The 5G system requires IP connectivity for N3, N6, and N9 interfaces. 
        The IP connectivity is assumed that it comprises of IP routing and L1/L2
        transport networks which are outside of 3GPP specifications.
      </t>
      
      <t>
         On N6 interface, point-to-point tunneling based on UDP/IPv6 may be used
         to deliver unstructured PDU type data. Then, the content information of
         the PDU may be mapped into UDP port number, and the UDP port numbers is
         pre-configured in the UPF and DN. This is described in the section 9.2

             Supporting deployment of multiple UPFs as anchors for a single PDU
             session

      <t>
        The 5G system allows to deploy multiple UPFs as anchors for a single 
        PDU session, and supports multihoming of a single PDU session for 
        such anchor UPFs.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Multihoming is provided with Branching Point (BP) or Uplink Classifier
        (UL CL) which are functionalities of UPF. BP provides forwarding of UL
        traffic towards the different PDU Session Anchors based on the source
        IPv6 prefixes and merge of DL traffic to the UE. UL CL provides
        destination based multihoming for load balancing.
      </t>
   
      <t>
        On UL side, multihoming of a single PDU session is achieved by a
        point-to-point (P2P) tunnel per anchor UPF. It means that multiple P2P
        paths are established from one source gNB or UPF to the multiple
        destination anchor UPFs for the PDU session.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        On DL side, one single multipoint-to-point (MP2P) path exists from the
        anchor UPFs to the source gNB or UPF for the PDU session in this
        multihoming case. It means that the paths from the anchor UPFs are
        merged into just one tunnel state at the source gNB or UPF for the PDU
        session.
      </t>
        
      <t>
        Multiple P2P paths on DL could also be used for multihoming. However it
        should be the multiple PDU sessions multihoming case where the
        destination gNB or UPF needs to maintain multiple tunnel states under
        the one PDU session to one UP tunnel architectural principle.
      </t>

      <t>
        However, P2P tunneling could increase explosively the number of states
        in UPF as the anchor UPF/DN incremented to the PDU session. Thereby
        single PDU session multihoming with MP2P path should be a better option
        for multihoming in terms of reducing total number of tunnel states.
      </t>

      <t>
        SSC mode 3 for session continuity in hand-over case uses a single PDU
        multihoming with BP to make sure make-before-break. It is described in
        the section 5.6.4 and 5.6.9 of <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
        Multihoming is also assumed to be used for edge computing scenario. Edge
        computing enables some services to be hosted close to the UE's access
        point of attachment, and achieves an efficient service delivery through
        the reduced end-to-end latency and load on the transport network. In
        edge computing, local user's traffic is routed or steered to application
        in the local DN by UPF. This refers the section 5.13 of <xref
        target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>.

      <t>
        The appropriate UPFs are selected for a PDU session based on parameters

      <t>
        In addition, deployment of multiple UPFs as anchors closed to UEs' site
        and connecting them without extra anchor points enable to make data path

        It is expected that multiple UPFs with per session tunnel handling for a
        PDU session becomes complicated task more and more for a SMF by
        increasing number of UPFs, and UP protocol shall support to aggregate
        several PDU sessions into a tunnel or shall be a session-less tunnel.

    <section anchor="eval_aspects" title="Evaluation Aspects">
      <t>
        This section provides UP protocol evaluation aspects that are mainly we
        derived from the architectural requirements described in <xref
        target="arch"/>. Those aspects are not prioritized by the order here.
        Expected deployment scenarios explain the evaluations purpose in the
        corresponding aspects. 
      </t>
      
      <t>
        As we were noticed that the gaps between GTP-U specifications and 5G
        architectural requirements through the analysis, those each gap are
        briefly described in the evaluation aspect associated to it.
      </t>
      
      <t>
         Since it is obvious that 5G system should be able to interwork with
         existing previous generation based systems, any aspects from coexisting
         and interworking point of view are not particularly articulated here.
         It may be described in a next version.
      </t>

         <section anchor="eval-pdu" title="Supporting PDU Session Type Variations">
          <t>
            Given that UP protocol is required to support all PDU session types:
            IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, and Unstructured. However, it is expected that
            some deployment cases allow candidate protocol to adopt only one or
            few PDU session type(s) for simplicity of operations. As we can
            expect that IPv4 connectivity services will be available through
            IPv6-only PDU session that enabled by bunch of IPv6 transition
            solutions already available in the field.
          </t>
            
          <t>
            For this, the expected evaluation points from this aspect should be
            whether there is substitutional means to cover other PDU session
            types. And how much it makes simple the system than deploying
            original PDU session types.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="eval-nature" title="Nature of Data Path">
          <t>
            As it is described in <xref target="archi-req"/>, the single PDU
            session multi-homing case requires multipoint-to-point (MP2P) data
            path. It should be much scalable than multi-homing with multiple PDU
            sessions because number of required path states in the UPFs are
            reduced as closed to egress endpoint. Against that point-to-point
            (P2P) protocol requires same number of states in each UPF throughout
            the path. 
          </t>
          
          <t>
            Supporting MP2P data path by GTP-U could be a gap in terms of single
            PDU session multi-homing, since GTP-U is a point-to-point tunneling
            protocol as it is described in <xref target="gtp-u"/>. 
          </t>
          
          <t>
            Therefore the expected evaluation points from this aspect is whether
            the nature of candidate UP protocols are to utilize MP2P data
            path.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="eval-transport" title="Supporting Transport Variations">
          <t>
            5G system will be expected that the new radio spectrums in high
            frequency bands require operators to deploy their base stations much
            dense for much wider areas compare to previous generation
            footprints. To make sure that density and coverage, all available
            types of transport in the field must be employed between RAN to UPF,
            or UPF to UPF.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            It is also expected that MTU size of each transport could be varied.
            Because one could be own fiber which the operator configure the MTU
            size as they like while others are third-party provided L2/L3 VPN
            lines which MTU size can't be controlled by the operators. So it is
            recommended MTU size discovery for each data path and dynamic MTU
            size adjustment mechanisms, while GTP-U does not support those
            mechanisms.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            As the study item in 3GPP mentioned, IPv6 is preferable address
            family not only for UEs, but also for the UP transport, in terms of
            size of available address space to support dense and wide footprint
            of base stations. However it increases header size from 20bytes to
            40bytes compare to IPv4. It could be a problem if the MTU size is
            uncontrollable, or only limited MTU size available to carry
            committed PDU size on the user plane.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The expected evaluation points from this aspect should be that the
            candidate protocols are able to dynamically adjust path MTU size
            with appropriate MTU size discovery mechanism. It also should be
            that how the candidate protocols leverage IPv6 to deal with header
            size increasing.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="eval-datapath" title="Data Path Management">
          <t>
            As <xref target="archi-req"/> described, the 5G systems allows user
            plane that flexible UPF selection, multiple anchor UPFs, and no
            limit on how many UPFs chained for the data path of the PDU session.
            UPF deployments in the field will thereby be distributed to be able
            to optimize the data path based on various logics and service
            scenarios.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            That powerful user plane capability could affect data path
            management complicated and difficult to be managed through the
            control plane, or operation support systems (OSS). Perhaps it could
            be the case where the UP protocol nature is P2P and it only supports
            per session base data path handling.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            Because it increases data path states by number of sessions, and
            number of endpoints of UPFs that makes data path handling much
            hectic and the control plane tend to be overloaded by not only usual
            attach/detach/hand-over operations, but also existing session
            manipulation triggered by UPF and transport nodes/paths restoration,
            etc.,
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The expected evaluation points from this aspect should be that how
            much the candidate protocols can reduce data path management loads
            both on the control plane NFs and UPFs compare to the per session
            based handling for P2P paths. It could possibly include N3 and N6 in
            addition to N9 while it supports flexible user plane data path
            optimizations for some example scenarios.
          </t>
        </section>
  
        <section anchor="eval-qos" title="QoS Control">
          <t>
            The QoS model is based on QoS flows to which QFI indicates in the 5G
            system that allows multiple QoS flows are aggregated into a single
            PDU session. So that it is given that the UP protocol should convey
            QFIs for a PDU session and the UPF needs to lookup them. It makes
            sure that reflects QoS policy in the 5G system to corresponding
            forwarding policy in the user plane IP transports.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            As we pointed out in <xref target="gtp-u-header"/>, the lookup
            process could impact UPF performance if the QFI container position
            in the header is unpredictable. It could happen many times along the
            path because the each UPFs should do it again and again in case that
            various different QoS policies are deployed in the networks under
            the UP as we discussed in <xref target="eval-transport"/>.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The expected evaluation points from this aspect should be whether
            the candidate protocols can provide stable ID space for QFI which
            shouldn't be a big deal since QFI just requires 6-bits space.
          </t>
        </section>
        
        
        <section anchor="eval-flow" title="Traffic Detection and Flow Handling">
          <t>
            As described in <xref target="UPF-Func"/>, UPF need to detect
            traffic flow specified by SMF within a PDU session, and enforce some
            processes to the PDU based on the pre-configured policy rule.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            As similar with QoS flow lookup described in <xref
            target="eval-qos"/>, UPFs along the path are repeatedly detecting an
            specified traffic flow in inner PDU. It could increase redundant
            flow detection load on every UPFs that could be avoided if the
            upstream UPF put some identifier which abstracts the detected flow
            into the packets. It enables following UPFs just find the ID to
            detect the indicated flow from the packet.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The expected evaluation points from this aspect should be whether
            the candidate protocols can provide means to reduce that redundant
            flow detection that could be enough bits space on stable ID space to
            put abstracted detected flow identifier.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="eval-slice" title="Supporting Network Slicing Diversity">
        
          <t>
            To embody network slicing, it is expected that various means should
            be available in case by case, or operator by operator, for their 5G
            systems while it follows the fundamental slicing concept, as
            described in <xref target="archi-overview"/>.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            As <xref target="TS.28.530-3GPP"/> described in section 4, UP
            underlay transport networks and UPFs are shared by network slices.
            The data model defined in <xref target="TS.29.510-3GPP"/> allows
            that a Network Instance, a UPF and its interfaces can belong to
            multiple slices as same as other type of NFs. UP endpoint IP
            prefix/address of an interface can also be shared with multiple
            interfaces on the UPF as the model doesn't make them slice unique.
          </t>

          <t> 
            The assumed slice operation in 5G architecture is that UPFs connect
            to each other through direct (virtual) link as <xref
            target="archi-overview"/> describes that UPFs compose a network
            slice on an UP. So IP routing and transport system underneath the UP
            are not visible from the 5G system. However some means need to
            indicate a slice on the shared underlying networks of the UP over
            the wire.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            That's just one way for network slicing, but it helps to reduce the
            operational burden while there's no 3GPP specification for slice
            lifecycle managements, such as create, update, and delete operations
            for slices. Even it depends on each operator's policy, sharing
            Network Instance, UPFs and the interfaces among slices makes
            operators relax and not to be much hustled on slice lifecycle
            management.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            It could also make sense in case that each network slice requires
            different forwarding policies in the middle of the path. Some
            identifier in the packets for a slice could be a glue between UP
            path and its underlying transport networks. For example, if a slice
            requires certain level of latency with dedicated route, traffic
            engineering (TE) embodies appropriate forwarding policy through the
            underlay transport network.
          </t>

          <t>
            The expected evaluation points from this aspect should be whether
            the candidate protocols can support to indicate a network slice in
            the UP packets that could be enough bits space on stable ID space to
            put slice identifier for the slice, or the forwarding policy within
            the slice. Since 5G control plane is not designed to handle
            transport resources, such as VLAN, MPLS Label, Tunnel ID except
            GTP-U, less impact to the control plane protocol and the APIs should
            be much preferable.

        We clarified GTP-U through the analysis and listed observed
        characteristics in <xref target="gtp-u-summary"/>. We also clarified the
        architectural requirements for UP protocol described in <xref
        target="archi-req"/>.
      </t>
        
      <t>
        As we identified some potential gaps between the current UP protocol and
        the architectural requirements even for Release 15, it is worth to study
        possible candidate UP protocols for the 5G system including current one.
        Our conclusion here is that we suggest the UP protocol study work in
        3GPP takes into account the evaluation aspects described in <xref
        target="eval_aspects"/>.
